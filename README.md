\# BP Critter Emote

The addon in your Interface/addons file will say, "CritterEmote." This is for continuity.

This addon will have your non-combat companion pets, aka Battle Pets,  do fun and random things.

When you have a pet out, it will emote something randomly every five (5) minutes or so as long as you aren't in combat. If you want them to emote something custom, you can use \`/ce\` instead of \`/emote, followed by the thing you would like the pet to say or do. Afterward, you will be asked if you wish to add that emote to a custom file. I do not have a check to see if you already have that emote in the file, yet.

Your pet will also respond to in-game interaction. Try \`/wave\` while targeting your pet.

They might just do something different when you target another player or NPC.

The Special Emotes table is used during the major in-game holidays.

I have set up localization files for German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Russian.  
I do not speak any of these languages fluently and rely on translation AI and other players to update me on correct usage.  
At times, my English needs correction, as well\! Thank you for that. 

\#\# Emotes

Currently, emotes relate to the battle pet as follows:  
\- \*\*Default\*\* \- for all critters.  
\- \*\*Type\*\* \- a subtype of critter (e.g., cat).  
\- \*\*Name\*\* \- specific pet (e.g., Lil' K.T.).

\#\# Areas in the Addon

In the addon, there are 3 distinct areas:  
1\. \*\*DB Emotes\*\* \- which happen when you target your pet and do an in-game slash command such as \`/cry\` or \`/wave.\`  
2\. \*\*Random Emotes\*\* \- This is broken into 6 categories:  
   \- General  
   \- Silly  
   \- Song  
   \- PVP  
   \- Special  
   \- Location  
3\. \*\*Target\*\* \- if something is targeted (including the pet), a random emote may be directed at the target.

\#\# Acknowledgements

CritterEmote was originally authored by Zompter as Critter Emote, then Seegeen as Chinchilla Critter Emote. I loved this add-on so much I just couldn't let it go. The abandoned addon guidelines required a rename for CurseForge, though it is still found under CritterEmote in the addon files.

Special thanks to Fysker for all his programming assistance.
